		<p><a href="https://www.theengineroom.org">The Engine Room</a>) 's Library collects what we're learning about using data and technology for social change. Each 'book' in the Library is a brief introduction to a topic, with links to other places where you can learn more.</p>
		<p>We're always finding information through our direct support, community and research work that we think should be shared as widely as possible. So, we summarise what we've found, and present it in a simple, easy-to-understand way.</p>
		<p>We try to keep every 'book' short, so that anyone can scroll through and quickly find what's relevant for them. We'd usually like to include a lot more information than we have space to include here. If you want to know more about a certain area, or think we should add something, <a href="http://theengineroom.org/contact/">get in touch</a>. Weâ€™d love to talk more.</p>

		<p>The contents of all the books in our Library, and the code behind it, are all openly-licensed and available on <a href="https://github.com/the-engine-room/library">GitHub</a>.  </p>
