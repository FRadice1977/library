## Satellite imagery

> ### Possible objectives
> * Collecting evidence of deforestation or forest degradation
> * Capturing evidence of companies’ wrongdoing in how they use land 
> * Recording and monitoring the environmental value of land or forest areas

### What is it

* Satellites orbiting the globe take photographs of the Earth’s surface from space, which can include images of forests or community land. 
* These photographs can be used to produce analysis of changes to a forest area over time, or combined with other forms of information, including other types of maps.

### How it can help
Satellite imagery was once too expensive for all but large institutions, governments and big corporations. Now, it is easily accessible and free (or very cheap). Comparing regular images of the same area can provide proof of deforestation, trends like increased commercial activity, or visible results of forest destruction like monocultures (which follow planting patterns that can be seen from above). 

### Tools
There are very good free, open-source tools to analyse satellite imagery: **QGIS** is the most widely used [GIS software](http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/index.html). QGIS lets users add, edit, manipulate, and present GIS data. It has less advanced features than ArcGIS (see [Mobile phone applications](/rainforest-tech-mobile-phones)), takes longer to learn and is less stable – but it is free, and has an active volunteer community providing technical support. You will need to know programming languages like Python for more complex analytical processes.

**Global Forest Watch (GFW)** is the most comprehensive tool for analysing satellite imagery of the [world’s forest cover](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/). GFW collects satellite images from partners and makes them free to download and re-use. It automatically analyses forest loss, provides alarm systems for fires and sends alerts when a selected area undergoes changes. 

### Costs
Satellite imagery can be [free](http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), while commercial purchases range between $10 and $50 per square kilometer, depending on [image quality](http://www.aaas.org/page/high-resolution-satellite-imagery-ordering-and-analysis-handbook#VI.). [SatSummit](http://landscape.satsummit.io/) provides a detailed breakdown of options and costs. Purchase costs aside, analysing satellite images is an expensive and labor-intensive task, requiring considerable investment in time (analysing thousands of high-resolution images), resources (fast computers) and skills (GIS experts). Global Forest Watch helps to bridge this gap, but it doesn't always have access to the high-quality imagery needed to show change in great detail.

### Risks and challenges
The main problem with satellite imagery is **resolution**, which currently means that image quality is too low to show change in detail. Global Forest Watch provides some imagery at 30 meters per pixel in some countries. Currently, worldwide forest change imagery at 30m resolution is only available once every year, which isn’t always fast enough to be used as proof of deforestation. 

This brings us to the second problem: **updates**. Images are usually updated monthly, and sometimes yearly. This makes them good for historical analysis, but sometimes impractical for real-time monitoring (though [DIY Aerial Photography](/rainforest-tech-diy-aerial-mapping) can help get more up-to-date images). This is changing, though: [Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/map/)'s GLAD alerts provide weekly alerts of likely tree cover loss in Peru, Republic of Congo, and Kalimantan (Indonesia), and [Libra](http://libra.developmentseed.org) provides Landsat data every two weeks. The [MAAP project](http://maaproject.org/about-maap/) also aims to produce updates on the Andean Amazon every 1-2 weeks, while companies like [Planet Labs](http://www.planet.com) promise to provide free daily images in the future.

Finally, cloudy weather can hide the forest areas below – it can take some time to get pictures that have been taken on a clear day.

### Case studies

#### Combining satellite data with other information sources 

The Indonesian rainforest organisation [Warsi](http://www.warsi.org/) combined satellite mapping data that they obtained from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat TM) and Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) with other information sources to document the distribution of the Orang Rimba people and their use of natural resources. 

**How did it help?**

* Warsi was able to combine the satellite data with GPS data and digital maps that they made by converting paper maps on natural resource concessions.
* The satellite imagery was relatively expensive for Warsi. Clouds sometimes covered crucial parts of the image, meaning that they needed to analyse a series of images to get a proper picture.
* The Bukit Duabelas national park now provides the Orang Rimba with user rights and formally protects the area, though deforestation remains a serious problem.

#### Using satellite data to provide evidence of illegal logging 

In January 2015 [Greenomics-Indonesia](http://www.greenomics.org/)’s analysis of two NASA Landsat images of Pulau Pedang island, off the coast of Sumatra, identified that large areas of peat forest had been cleared. 

**How did it help?**

* Greenomics used the information to target paper company Asia Pacific Resources International Holdings Limited (APRIL), which had publicly promised to end new plantation development by January 2014. 
* Greenomics chose to release this information to the media in English, producing a statement with images of their claim. In March 2015, APRIL publicly admitted there had been a breach and suspended a contractor and a [plantation manager](http://www.greenomics.org/docs/Greenomics_Press-Release_SFMP_Violation-(LowRes).pdf).
