## DIY aerial photography

> ### Possible Objectives
> * Collecting evidence of deforestation or forest degradation
> * Capturing evidence of companies’ wrongdoing in how they use land 
> * Supporting communities by presenting and providing knowledge 
> * Providing concrete evidence to governments to encourage them to recognise indigenous lands

### What is it
* Aerial photography can be produced by drones (flying vehicles without a human pilot), balloons or kites attached to a digital camera that takes pictures throughout the flight.
* Computer software combines (or ‘stitches’) these photos into maps or 3D models, which can be used for purposes including monitoring wildlife, recording land claims and documenting climate change impacts.

### How it can help
High-resolution maps can be expensive, out-of-date or difficult to access (see [Satellite Mapping](/monitoring-satellite-imagery)). Creating aerial maps yourself gives you detailed map data for the exact area you want, in real time. It also allows you to fly over the same area regularly – giving you evidence of change over time. 

### Tools 
If you have a low budget and only want to cover a small area, kites and balloons are the cheapest and easiest option (see [Costs](#costs), below). They can be constructed from simple materials or pre-prepared kits [(1)](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/balloon-mapping) [(2)](http://publiclaboratory.org/wiki/kite-mapping) . If tree cover restricts where you can fly balloons and kites, you will need to spend more on a drone. There are two main types: a drone with four or more multiple rotors (easier to fly, but can only fly for around 30 minutes), or a remote-controlled ‘fixed-wing’ plane (these can fly for up to 60 minutes – easier to fix but harder to land). You will also need a simple digital camera, software to plan flight paths, fly the drone, and edit photos.

### <a href="costs"></a>Costs
While the materials needed to create and build a drone, balloon or kite are cheaper than ever before, use them effectively will take time, basic practical skills and the patience to learn new software. Allocate staff time to training, technical adjustments, managing data and communicating with communities where you will be flying. A basic kite able to carry a small camera can cost as little as USD 70, and you can buy a balloon kit for around USD 200. Kits are [available](http://www.openrelief.org/home/open-source-airframe/) that allow drones to be created for around USD 1,000-USD 2,000. ConservationDrones also collects unused drones and donates them to rainforest-related groups. Free, open source autopilot and map creation software is available, and the [ConservationDrones](http://conservationdrones.org), [DIYDrones](http://diydrones.com/) and the [Humanitarian UAV](http://uaviators.org/about-this-site-rules) network can offer ([often free](http://opendronemap.github.io/odm/)) advice and support. 

### Risks and challenges
Drones and DIY aerial photography are new technologies, and best practices and legal regulations are still being developed. The Humanitarian UAV network’s [code of conduct](https://uaviators.org/docs) is an excellent document to follow, and see also [this list of regulations](http://wiki.uaviators.org/doku.php) on flying drones in different countries.

Involve local communities wherever possible, involving them in conducting the mapping themselves. Ensure that they understand exactly what data is being collected and how it will be used. Remove any information that identifies individuals, and share the information you have collected with the community being mapped afterwards. Some countries are starting to introduce legal restrictions on who can fly a drone and where - check whether it is legal before you start. 

### Case studies

#### Building and flying a drone in collaboration with the local community
In 2014, members of the Wapichan community in Guyana and the organization [Digital Democracy](http://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/we-built-a-drone/) built a fixed-wing drone using a kit, a GoPro camera (available from around $100) and free open-source software. The drone was then used to create a detailed 3D model of Sholinab, a local village.

**How did it help?**

* The Wapichan monitoring team had no previous engineering experience but were able to build the drone using materials from the local area, making the drone a more familiar object that they had built together.
* Team members first learned to fly the drone without an autopilot. Although there were difficulties in landing at first, it helped them to gain confidence in how the drone worked.
* The group identified several possible uses for the drone in future, including monitoring deforestation over time, mapping villages to allocate the management of resources, and documenting illegal logging.


#### Exposing illegal logging using a drone 
In 2014, [ConservationDrones](http://conservationdrones.org/2014/10/24/recycle/) and the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme (SOCP) used a drone to take aerial photographs of part of the Gunung Leuser National Park in Indonesia. The organisation flew over the same area twice in two months, producing clear photographic evidence that illegal logging had taken place. 

**How did it help?**

* Without aerial photography, the logging might not have have been discovered: the loggers had hidden their activities at ground level by leaving a strip of trees around the logged area.
* ConservationDrones and SOCP gave the evidence to park officials, who [were able](http://conservationdrones.org/2014/09/30/illegal-logging/) to stop logging activities in that area.
