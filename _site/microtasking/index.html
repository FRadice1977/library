    <h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p>Microtasking is the process of splitting a large job into small tasks that can be distributed, over the Internet, to many people. Machines and algorithms are very efficient at certain functions, such as identifying patterns in an image or performing advanced calculations, but other tasks, including identifying the contents of an image or recognizing obscure text, are still best performed by humans.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This process has been used for over ten years in the commercial sector. Microtasking <em>workplaces</em> like <a href="https://www.mturk.com">Mechanical Turk</a> or <a href="http://www.clickworker.com/">ClickWorker</a> connect businesses with people around the world to outsource small tasks for pay. Example tasks include tagging photos from social media, typing out business card information from a photo, and digitising receipts and invoices.</p>

<p>Increasingly, this technology is being used by the not for profit sector. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>extracting data from images of disaster and accelerate damage assessments (<a href="geotagx.org">GeotagX</a>, <a href="http://micromappers.org/">Micromappers</a>, <a href="http://www.planetaryresponsenetwork.com/beta/">Planetary Response Network</a>)</li>
  <li>identifying deforestation, forest degradation, or fire haze (<a href="http://fires.globalforestwatch.org/">Global Forest Watch Fires</a>)</li>
  <li>digitising government documents into open data (<a href="http://vozdata.lanacion.com.ar">La Nacion’s VozData</a>). </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools-and-platforms">Tools and Platforms</h2>

<p>The experiences and lessons shared here were gathered through interviews with ten people who represented the following microtasking platforms and initiatives. These projects covered a wide range of levels of sophistication and volunteer engagement, ranging from tens of volunteers to tens of thousands. Some were large organisations with dedicated communications teams, while others were small initiatives who recruited a volunteer developer for a week to build a platform.</p>

<h2 id="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</h2>

<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<p>Microtasking has two principal benefits.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting data that would otherwise be time-consuming to process or impossible to access. Any problem that can be broken into small tasks can potentially be crowdsourced to volunteers. Popular microtasking mechanisms include answering questions, transcribing information, identifying points, drawing shapes, and comparing two pieces of data.</li>
  <li>Engaging volunteers actively in an issue. A major challenge for many member-driven organizations is turning web-based support into real world action. Beyond sharing information or providing financial support (often derided as “clicktivism”), microtasking offers volunteers the opportunity to be actively involved, learn more about an issue, and make a meaningful contribution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<p>Microtasking won’t be an effective solution for some organizations or projects. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Stretching resource-constrained organizations. Significant staff time may be required to engage volunteers, monitor the quality of their work, and keep them motivated. Resource-constrained organizations may not be able to undertake microtasking easily.</li>
  <li>Skewing results for nefarious or benign reasons. Microtasking creates the potential that a small number of contributors could skew the data produced by the platform. This could be for political and commercial reasons, or because users were not using the platform in that way that was intended.</li>
  <li>Dividing opinions on data reliability. Because microtasking is a radical departure from existing research methods, it will draw doubt. Some will question the quality of data submitted by volunteers. Others may view it as an unnecessary disruption to existing workflows from untrusted individuals. </li>
</ul>

<p>Interviewees also noted the following more general risks.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Microtasking contributions are inherently unpredictable – both in terms of quantity and quality. Setting up an advocacy campaign dependent on microtasking data before having the data to back up the claims involves a leap of faith.</li>
  <li>Allowing the public to contribute their own content necessarily involves giving up some control over what is communicated on the platform.</li>
  <li>Volunteers contributing to humanitarian response may be exposed to sensitive and sometimes highly graphic content, so the opening of this information to the broader public poses ethical challenges. Organizations must take serious steps to ensure that no harm comes to those who choose to engage in their work.</li>
  <li>Even well-intended volunteers may also accidentally use the platform in a way that was not intended. </li>
</ol>
